# MafiaGame
Description:
Mafia Game is an application for the "Mafia" game host, which provides a user-friendly interface and automated functions for managing the game, tracking moves, counting points and fouls. This application allows the host to easily and efficiently manage the game without the need for paper records and manual counting. Ideal for amateur play or tournament.

Main functions:

-Current Turn Display: The application shows the current game progress, indicating which game stage is currently active, such as "Night", "Day", "Voting", etc.

-Accounting for players and roles: Allows the host to maintain a list of players and their roles, as well as make changes during the game, such as adding or removing players, changing their roles, etc.

-Game progress control: The application automatically switches the stages of the game, based on the rules of the Mafia. For example, after completing the "Night" automatically goes to the "Day" and so on.

-Voting Tracking: Allows the host to track votes and record player votes. After voting is complete, the application displays the results and announces the player with the most votes.

-Score and Foul Recording: The app automatically calculates points and fouls for each player based on Mafia game rules. This helps the facilitator quickly assess the current situation and make the necessary decisions.

-User-friendly interface: The application has an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface that allows the presenter to quickly access the necessary information and perform the necessary actions.

Technologies:
